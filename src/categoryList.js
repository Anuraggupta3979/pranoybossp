    description: `Right from the earth, straight to your soul.
    Terracotta items are made with a fairly coarse and porous type of clay and then are baked until hard, gaining a tinge of colors ranging from earthy ochre to auburn. What makes the end product distinctive from region to region in India, is its different clay type and color as well as the sensibilities of the artist and varied cultural practices of the region. In a more contemporary setting, the ethnic tint can be used to break up and add warmth to the modern, monochromatic themes. The most iconic terracotta items include earthen-wares, pots, figurines, and tons of other decorative items.
