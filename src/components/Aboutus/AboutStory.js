      <p className="text-center storypera">
        From tales of tradition, from dusty workshops and the smell of the
        earth, Akkaara was born. It was shaped by the potter, on his wheel and
        by the carpenter’s steady hand. By the prick of the needle and the
        chisel on stone. This is the world where our stories are told. In places
        and practices from time immemorial, in folklore and fables that have
        somehow been forgotten. Handcrafted to glorious imperfection, each piece
        in the Akkaara collection recalls the story of it’s own identity.

        Akkaara brings you premium lifestyle products inspired by folklore and
        traditional crafts. Our products are handcrafted by artisans who have
        honed their skills over generations of practice. Each product in the
        Akkaara collection is designed with intricate care and concern. Concern
        for tradition, concern for the material and concern for the artisans.
        Through each product, Akkaara strives to revive what has been lost – the
        exquisite splendour of traditional arts, the cultural heritage of
        generations of craftspeople and the memory of age-old stories, embedded
        in traditional wisdom and folklore.
